### Retrospective 5

During this iteration our team fixed a lot of bug issues. We added more functionality to features such as a delete feature to the applicant/employer profiles.
We also added a skill tags feature for each job (optional), impressions for the jobs (viewership), fixed the related jobs feature so that it's not static (still needs to be updated but there's a working version of the feature)


We had good communication and colloboration this iteration. A lot of us worked together on different issues and provided help to others. The deployment now works for both frontend and backend. We have some database issues but we're working on fixing them.

## For Final Submission

-Go through each user story and make sure it's working as intended.

-Close out remaining issues and make sure the application is as polished as possible.

-Update UI, consistency, and make sure there are no errors when clicking on anything. Some UI elements are still not "pretty" so updating those
